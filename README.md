In this project I created a a euchre game that can be played in terminal with 1-4 players and also includes an AI player.

Entire program is done in c++

The program includes 4 classes:

  - Euchre:
    - Drives the programs by playing a hands and keeping the score of the game until a team scores the necessary amount of points
   
  - Pack:
    - Includes functions for working with a pack of cards including dealing the cards and shuffling the cards
   
  - Player:
    - Class for a player including adding or discarding a card, leading a card, playing a card, making a trump card as well as creating the AI player

  - Card:
    - Includes functions that are needed for a specific card including determining trump card, determine which two cards is better, and the suit of the card
